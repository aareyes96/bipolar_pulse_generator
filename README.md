# bipolar_pulse_generator

This is the answer for this exercise:

Develop a circuit, which can create bi-polar pulses for muscle / nerve stimulation. The pulse need to have different frequencies from 1Hz to up to 100Hz and step up the current from 1mA to 50mA in e.g. 10 steps. Please also integrate a security circuit to prevent injuries. Also please integrate a Bluetooth-Chipset + Antenna and a microcontroller to handle everything.
